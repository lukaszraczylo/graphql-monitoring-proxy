## graphql monitoring proxy

Creates a passthrough proxy to a graphql endpoint(s), allowing you to analyse the queries and responses, producing the Prometheus metrics at a fraction of the cost - because, as we know - $0 is a fair price.

This project is in active use by [telegram-bot.app](https://telegram-bot.app), and was tested with 30k queries per second on a single instance, consuming 10 MB of RAM and 0.1% CPU.

### Why this project exists

I wanted to monitor the queries and responses of our graphql endpoint. Still, we didn't want to pay the price of the graphql server itself ( and I will not point fingers at a particular well-known project), as monitoring and basic security features should be a standard, free functionality.

### Endpoints

* `:8080/*` - the graphql passthrough endpoint
* `:9393/metrics` - the prometheus metrics endpoint
* `:8080/healthz` - the healthcheck endpoint
* `:8080/livez` - the liveness probe endpoint
* `:9090/api/*` - the monitoring proxy API endpoint

### Speed

#### Caching

The cache engine is enabled in the background by default, using no additional resources.
You can then start using the cache by setting the `ENABLE_GLOBAL_CACHE` environment variable to `true` - which will enable the cache for all queries without introspection. You can leave the global cache disabled and enable the cache for specific queries by adding the `@cached` directive to the query.

In the case of the `@cached` you can add additional parameters to the directive which will set the cache for specific queries to the provided time.
For example, `query MyCachedQuery @cached(ttl: 90) ....` will set the cache for the query to 90 seconds.

### Security

#### Role-based rate limiting

You can rate limit requests using the `ROLE_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable. If enabled, the proxy will rate limit the requests based on the role claim in the JWT token. You can then provide the JSON file in the following format to specify the limits.
The default interval is `second`, but you can use other values as well. If you want to disable the rate limiting for a specific role, you can set the `req` to `0`.

Available values:
`nano`, `micro`, `milli`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`

To define path in JWT token where the current user role is present, use the `JWT_ROLE_CLAIM_PATH` environment variable.

You can also set up the `ROLE_FROM_HEADER` environment variable to extract the role from the header instead of the JWT token. This is useful if you want to rate limit the requests for unauthenticated users. It's worth mentioning that `ROLE_FROM_HEADER` takes a priority over the `JWT_ROLE_CLAIM_PATH` environment variable and if its set, the proxy will not try to extract the role from the JWT token.

*Default/sample configuration:*

```json
{
  "ratelimit": {
      "admin": {
          "req": 100,
          "interval": "second"
      },
      "guest": {
          "req": 50,
          "interval": "minute"
      },
      "-": {
          "req": 100,
          "interval": "day"
      }
  }
}
```

If you'd like to change it - mount your configmap as `/app/ratelimit.json` file.
Remember to include the `-` role, which is used for unauthenticated users or when claim can't be found for any reason.
If rate limit has been reached - the proxy will return `429 Too Many Requests` error.


#### Read-only mode

You can enable the read-only mode by setting the `READ_ONLY_MODE` environment variable to `true` - which will block all the `mutation` queries.

#### Allowing access to listed URLs

You can allow access only to certain URLs by setting the `ALLOWED_URLS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of URLs. If enabled - other URLs will return `403 Forbidden` error and request will **not** reach the proxied service.

#### Blocking introspection

You can block the schema introspection by setting the `BLOCK_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION` environment variable to `true` - which will block all the queries with introspection parts, like:

`__schema`, `__type`, `__typename`, `__directive`, `__directivelocation`, `__field`, `__inputvalue`, `__enumvalue`, `__typekind`, `__fieldtype`, `__inputobjecttype`, `__enumtype`, `__uniontype`, `__scalars`, `__objects`, `__interfaces`, `__unions`, `__enums`, `__inputobjects`, `__directives`

If you'd like to keep blocking of the schema introspection on but allow one or more of from the list of above for any reason, you can use the `ALLOWED_INTROSPECTION` environment variable to specify the list of allowed queries.

`ALLOWED_INTROSPECTION="__typename,__type"`

### API endpoints

#### Ban or unban the user

Your monitoring system can detect user misbehaving, for example trying to extract / scrap the data. To prevent user from doing so you can use the simple API to ban the user from accessing the application.

To do so - you need to enable the api by setting env variable `ENABLE_API=true` which will expose the API on the port `API_PORT=9090`. Nedless to say - keep it secure and don't expose it outside of your cluster.

 Then you can use the following endpoints:

* `POST /api/user-ban` - ban the user from accessing the application
* `POST /api/user-unban` - unban the user from accessing the application

Both endpoints require the `user_id` parameter to be present in the request body and allow you to provide the reason for the ban.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:9090/api/user-ban \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "user_id": "1337",
      "reason": "Scraping data"
    }'
```

Ban details will be stored in the `banned_users.json` file, which you can mount as a file or configmap to the `/go/src/app/banned_users.json` path ( or use `BANNED_USERS_FILE` environment variable to specify the path to the file). The file operation is important if you have multiple instances of the proxy running, as it will allow you to ban the user from accessing the application on all instances.
